"""Functional programming implementation of the onboard controller.

We reimplement the onboard controller for two reasons:
- We cannot use the C++ bindings of the firmware to differentiate through the onboard controller.
- We need to implement it with JAX to enable efficient, batched computations.

Since our controller is a PID controller, it requires integration of the error over time. We opt for
a functional implementation to avoid storing any state in the class. Doing so would either prevent
us from easily scaling across batches and drones with JAX's `vmap`, or require us to support batches
and multiple drones explicitly in the controller.
