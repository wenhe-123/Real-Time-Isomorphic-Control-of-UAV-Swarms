# axswarm

## Overview

**axswarm** is a high-speed, research-grade trajectory planner for drone swarms, now fully reimplemented in Python using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) for automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU acceleration.

The AMSwarm algorithm was first proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04856). The implementation in this branch follows the original fixed-setpoint formulation with an explicit drone dynamics model and a pure Python/JAX implementation. It eliminates the previous C++ core, making installation and usage dramatically simpler, and further optimizes the algorithm to improve parallelization.

The new API is streamlined and functional, with all core logic and data structures exposed in Python. The codebase is easy to read, extend, and integrate with modern simulation environments.

## Key Features

- **Pure JAX Implementation**: No C++ or pybind11 required. All computation is vectorized and JIT-compiled with JAX.
- **Simple, Functional API**: Core entry points are just a few functions and data classes.
- **Swarm Trajectory Optimization**: Efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-time or batch planning.
- **Flexible Settings and Data Structures**: All configuration and data are Python dataclasses, easy to serialize and modify.
- **Easy Installation**: No build step—just install Python dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or simply add to your project and install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

See `examples/simulate.py` for a full simulation loop. Here's a minimal example:

```python
import numpy as np
from axswarm import SolverData, SolverSettings, solve

# Prepare current target setpoints and current/initial states
setpoints = {
    "pos": ...,  # [n_drones, 3]
    "vel": ...,  # [n_drones, 3], optional and defaults to zero
    "acc": ...,  # [n_drones, 3], optional and defaults to zero
}
initial_states = ...  # [n_drones, 6], position followed by velocity

# Prepare settings (see axswarm/settings.py for all options)
settings = SolverSettings(
    max_iters=20,
    rho_init=1.0,
    rho_max=10.0,
    # ... other settings ...
    pos_min=np.array([-2, -2, 0]),
    pos_max=np.array([2, 2, 2]),
    collision_envelope=np.array([0.3, 0.3, 0.3]),
    # etc.
)

# Initialize solver data
solver_data = SolverData.init(
    setpoints=setpoints,
    initial_states=initial_states,
    K=settings.K,
    N=settings.N,
    A=..., B=..., A_prime=..., B_prime=...,
    freq=settings.freq,
    smoothness_weight=settings.smoothness_weight,
    input_smoothness_weight=settings.input_smoothness_weight,
    input_continuity_weight=settings.input_continuity_weight,
)

# Run the solver for one step
states = ...  # current [n_drones, 6] state (pos, vel)
success, iters, solver_data = solve(states, solver_data, settings)
```

For a full simulation loop and visualization, see `examples/simulate.py`.

## Package Structure

- `axswarm/`
  - `data.py`: Defines all main data structures, especially `SolverData` (holds all state, setpoints, matrices, etc.).
  - `settings.py`: Contains the `SolverSettings` dataclass for all solver and constraint parameters.
  - `solve.py`: Implements the main `solve` function and all optimization logic.
  - `constraint.py`, `spline.py`: Helper modules for constraints and trajectory representation.
  - `__init__.py`: Exposes the main API: `SolverData`, `SolverSettings`, `solve`.

### API Overview

- **`SolverData`**: Holds all mutable state for the solver, including setpoints, cost matrices, and current trajectories. Created via `SolverData.init(...)`.
- **`SolverSettings`**: All solver and constraint parameters, as a dataclass.
- **`solve(states, data, settings)`**: The main functional entry point. Advances the swarm trajectories by one step, returning success flags, iteration counts, and updated data.
- **Functional, stateless design**: All state is explicit; no global variables or hidden state.

## Example Directory

- `examples/simulate.py`: End-to-end simulation of four drones switching positions, including visualization and integration with a simulator.
- `examples/utils.py`: Helper functions for visualization.
